- ðŸ“« How to reach me pfranz1@lsu.edu

I love to write code. Its my favorite activity. Its a combination of three things I love:
* Puzzle solving
* Longterm strategizing
* Creating neat things

Im a aspire to be a full stack developer, and I enjoy the challange and perspective that learning a technology provides.

My favorite language is Dart / Flutter. Null safety, named parameters, first class fuction objects, and autoformating make it such a joy to work with.

My least favorite language  is Scheme48. It beat me up while writing an interpreter for it in Programing Languages class. It really makes me appreciate modern langauges.

Im very pleased with how an app to help my best friend who is a swim coach came together. Its still a work in progress and I can't wait to have more time to devote to it. Elapsed: https://pfranz1.github.io/swim_timer/#/
